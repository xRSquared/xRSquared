I'm an Applied Data Scientist with a Full-Stack Developer's toolkit,
based in Los Angeles.

## ⚡️ A Few Quick Facts

- 🤓 I love Math, Data Science, and Programming

- 🧠 I’m addicted to expanding my skillset every day

  - Currently learning about **MLOps**, **Distributed Systems**,
    and **AI**(Large Language Models).

- 📝 I ~~regularly~~ write articles on [my blog](https://ricardoruiz.site/blog).

- 📕 Check out my [CV](https://ricardoruiz.site/cv/CV_Ricardo_Ruiz.pdf)

> I'm currently looking for new opportunities in Data Science or Software Engineering.

You can reach me [here](https://ricardoruiz.site/contact).

## 👷 Things I'm Doing

I recently discovered a hole in the regex ecosystem of Python and Rust.
So I'm working on making writing readable regular expressions in both languages easier.

- **natural-regex**: Pythonic Natural-language regular expressions
- **natural-regex-rs**: Natural-language regular expressions in Rust

> These are my first of hopefully many open-source contributions.

**Additional Personal Projects**:

These are some long-horizon personal projects that I am working on:

- **Knowledge Box**: A personal "search engine."

  - It uses sentence embeddings and a vector database to search
    my personal "knowledge base" with natural language.

- **Adainference**: Adaptive experimentation made easy

## 🧠 Things I'm Learning

- Rust
- Operationalizing [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)

## 🤝 I’m Looking To Collaborate On…

- Creating functional products for end-users using state of the art AI models.
