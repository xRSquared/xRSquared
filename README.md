# About Me

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ricardo, an applied Data Scientist with a full-stack developer's toolkit,
based in Los Angeles.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities in Data Science or Software Engineering.

You can reach me here or at my [email](mailto:ricardo.w.ruiz@gmail.com).

## ðŸ‘· Things I'm doing

I recently discovered a hole in the regex ecosystem of python and rust.
So I'm working on making writing readable regular expressions in both languages easier.

- **natural-regex**: Pythonic Natural-language regular expressions
- **natural-regex-rs**: Natural-language regular expressions in rust

> These are my first of hopefully many open-source contributions.

**Additional Personal Projects**:

These are some long-horizon personal projects that I am working on:

- **Knowledge Box**: A personal "search engine"

  - uses sentence embeddings, and a vector database to allow me to create a
    vector database to search with natural language.

- **Adainference**: Adaptive experimentation made easy

## Things I'm learning

- Rust
- Operationalizing [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
